<p>The <a href="https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/">Genomics England PanelApp</a> provides panels of genes related to human disorders manually curated by healthcare experts. From a clinical and research perspective, this is a remarkable resource. At the time of writing this post, over 320 panels have been published.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can only download the panels manually one at a time or through an API that retrieves the information as a JSON file.</p>
<p>Alternatively, below you can find a script in R to extract all the panels from the website and merge them into a single dataset. Please note the following points before using the script:</p>
<ul>
<li>I only consider genes labeled as “Expert Review Green” defined as “gene-disease association with a high level of evidence” and exclude STRs and CNVs entities. More information on the criteria used can be found on the main page (heading: Understanding gene classifications in a version 1+ gene panel.</li>
<li>The script selects only a subset of columns from the total available.
Be careful, the script will download more than 320 files automatically (on my laptop, the execution process is ~7 min).</li>
<li>The script is ready to run on the Linux system.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the script is based on the current website structure, any changes could break the code. Please let me know if this happens. I will try to code an updated version of the code.</p>
